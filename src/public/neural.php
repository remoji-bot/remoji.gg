  We use distributed neural network cloud artificial intelligence based machine learning with blockchain and concurrency based transactional multi-paradigm graphql database optimisation to handle big data via hand crafted search engine optimisation algorithms (including DirectX and Vulcan support with real time raytracing to trace and validate payments), all while making use of the internet of things and quantum computing over our state of the art 5g network to bring payment as-a-service that supports cryptocurrencies to you and your business. Why not use legacy systems such as bitcoin, ethereum and ripple? Why not use legacy databases and languages such as mysql, php, ruby and python? Why not use legacy hardware such as the Intel Core i7-7700K or the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti? Why not use legacy operating systems such as Windows 7 or Windows 10? Why not use legacy payment platforms such as PayPal, Stripe or Square?
